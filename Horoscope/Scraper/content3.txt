Virgo
Solitude is an important theme for Virgos—after all, your Tarot card is the Hermit. Today you'll reconsider some of your Hermit-like qualities. Perhaps it's time to come back to civilization? Or maybe you need more time up on that mountain. Only you know for sure.
Libra
You're great at placing yourself in someone else's shoes—in fact, you're so good, often astrologers say that's one of Libra's worst characteristics, because you tend to think more about others than yourself. You'll learn a lot today about whether or not this is true of you.
Scorpio
You're excellent at understanding people's motivations and you're highly psychic, Scorpio, but that doesn't mean you're always great at teamwork or compromise. You'll be challenged to consider someone else's point of view today—and, in doing so, you'll learn a lot about yourself.

You really don't like it when shit goes on behind your back, Aquarius, but tonight you could get to the bottom of things in a major way. There's a high possibility for weirdness in your intimate relationships this evening, but maybe that could be fun?
Pisces
Your relationships are a huge focus this evening! If you've been feeling unsure which ways things are heading, tonight you may be able to get a handle on things. You've got friends in high places, and you may run into a few of them tonight.Aries
There's a lot of talk going on today, Aries, but don't be so sure you can trust it. The Moon is in logical Gemini, and you're feeling particularly sharp; however, the mysteries you face this evening aren't ones that can be solved in one night.
Taurus
You're itching to buy something that you think will bring happiness: Don't do it, Taurus. Whatever it is you think you need, it may not be worth the price, or it could be completely worthless. Tonight's hazy, dreamy Neptune vibe could bring the kind of fun you're looking for, but don't take candy from strangers.
Gemini
The Moon is in your sign, Gemini! You adore details: You read the fine print for fun, and finding errors and hidden meanings is your thing. These small details create the big picture; today, Gemini, embrace this big picture. Don't overthink things today—you'll drive yourself crazy.
Cancer
To tell you today would be an emotional day would be cheating, since every day is emotional for you. However, today is particularly sensitive. If someone hurts your feelings, I promise, Cancer: They're stupid, they don't know what they're talking about, and they were trying to piss you off.
Leo
The Moon is in a super social sign, Gemini, and you're so feeling up for networking and meeting new people; however, things may not go as planned. Watch out for used car salesmen. Flexibility is your key to a great evening, but perhaps skip the transit drama, and invite people over rather than going out.
Virgo
Things might feel too good to be true today, but I want you to stay optimistic: Even if things don't work out, you can call today practice for when they finally do. Your partners are feeling freaky and weird tonight—get it, Virgo!
Libra
The Moon is in fellow intellectual Air sign Gemini, inspiring you to check out a museum or two. But maybe don't bother? The pretentious assholes you'll run into today will make you nauseous. Especially if they're wearing fedoras.
Scorpio
You might get way too mixed up in other people's business today, Scorpio—but let's face it, you love a good drama, and you love secrets. Dirty laundry is your thing. Tonight's annoying if you have over-complicated plans. Keep it simple for a successful Friday night.
Sagittarius
You are the luckiest sign in the zodiac, Sagittarius, and today, with the Moon in your opposite sign, Gemini, you indeed could get lucky. Just don't make any promises, or dates, you can't keep. For some unknown reason, you wild centaur, people are counting on you.
Capricorn
The Moon in logical Gemini has you meditating on your schedule and how you can improve things. First step: you have to create a better work/life balance. A lack of harmony between work and home will bite you in the butt today. Get on fixing that.
Aquarius
The Moon is in fellow social Air sign Gemini, but you're feeling a little torn: Are you a flirtatious Aquarius today, or are you really not feeling that romantic vibe? Perhaps today you'd rather keep it platonic. Either way, watch out for miscommunications this evening.
Pisces
There's a weird amount of pressure on you today, Pisces, but if you can get through today, you can do anything. Your partnerships demand plenty of attention at this time, but you can't sacrifice your need for alone time or your desire for success.Aries
The Moon in luxurious Taurus tends to bring your mind to material matters: your money, your looks, your outfit, all of which look great! Lately, however, you've felt under-appreciated. No worries, in a few days, Venus will end its current retrograde, and all will be well with the world. 
Taurus
Your ruling planet, Venus, is retrograde and out of sorts, but whatever: The Moon is in your sign today. It's a fine day, especially if you're reading this after mid-morning, which is when you'll be really, really annoyed.
Gemini
The Moon is in zen Taurus today, and your mind is drifting off toward deep matters. What secrets lurk around you? What's your twin hiding behind their back, Gemini? You might be the zodiac gossip, but you don't like to pry. Today, however, you may be inclined to.
Cancer
The Moon is in Earthy Taurus, a sign that's quite compatible with your Water vibes, Cancer. Sleep in if you want to avoid drama, and forgive your friend or lover who freaked out at you early today— it was a stressful morning, but the rest of the day will be chill.
Leo
You love the spotlight, but this morning things could get a little tense or awkward. Don't post or tweet anything unless you're sure you'll get the reaction you want. The rest of the day is productive, with plenty of good vibes.
Virgo
It's a stressful morning; you're waking up to unusual and possibly troubling dreams and ideas. No worries, though: the rest of the day will be as smooth as fellow Virgo Beyonce's skin. You might be the most practical sign, but today, embrace your psychic side.
Libra
This morning is filled with drama, but it's not yours, so who cares? The rest of the day is easygoing, with the Moon in Earth sign Taurus. You're extra psychic and tapped in today, too: Perhaps bust out your tarot deck?

Pisces
This morning kind of sucks, but knowing you, Pisces, you likely slept through it. If you didn't, I'm sorry for your nervous, confrontational morning, and I promise, the rest of the day will be much easier. Expect to feel chatty and social! It's also a great day to learn something new.Aries
There's a lot happening going on for you financially or around your responsibilities; due to your ability to take charge, things could work out quite well. You're naturally bossy, Aries, and if your work ethic is strong, mega success is on the way.
Taurus
The Moon is in your sign today, Taurus! Life feels easy and things just click, which is such a reward, considering all the stress you've been through with Venus, your ruling planet, being retrograde. You'll see things in a new light this evening and you'll reconnect with your vision for your future.
Gemini
As logical and bright as you are, Gemini, there are things that even you don't understand. Surprise: You, Gemini, are one of the mysteries you can't crack. Today; however, you may have some revelations about yourself. Issues around home, family and/or your responsibilities could also kick up today.

Sagittarius
With your ruling planet Jupiter, the planet of luck and growth, in hardworking Virgo, you're so psyched to watch your star rise. The Moon is in reliable Taurus, so slacking off is not advised— but, awesomely, Sag, you have no desire to!
Capricorn
Things are working so easily today, it's almost making you paranoid. What kind of weird conspiracy is going on, Capricorn? Whatever it is, it's great. New opportunities are coming your way from every angle. Go out tonight. 
Aquarius
The Moon is in lazy Taurus, and, if you can stay home today, do it. Improving your space to make it more comfy and functional is the best way to work with today's positive vibes. Also, super deep thoughts are on your mind today: A quiet, private place is precisely where you need to be. 
Pisces
The only sign that might be lazier than you, Pisces, is Taurus, and today, that's where the Moon is hanging out. While today does have chill vibes, your mind is active and communication is on its way, especially in the realm of relationships. It's a great night to talk it out.Aries

Taurus
You're in the last stretch of all kinds of bullshit, Taurus, especially relating to your home situation, your family, or your roommates. Nostalgia over the past may fill your mind—but remember that time isn't linear. It could all come back around again in a new form, place, and space.

Libra
If you're one of those Libras who are terrified of confrontation, stay home with your phone off today. People are weird and erratic early this afternoon, and you're bound to have some spastic social interactions. Also, you're ready for a new pack of friends: it's coming soon!
Scorpio
Usually, if you have to force something to happen or to work out, it won't be as great or real as it would if you just let it be. You're learning this lesson, especially around your career or reputation. Sudden surprises in your schedule may throw you off, so stay flex.
Sagittarius
Unexpected flirtations will come your way this afternoon, Sagittarius! It's a strange day; you're feeling a little unsure about your goals and dreams, but the Moon in fellow Fire sign Aries is keeping things fun and adding a dash of romance.
Capricorn
Sometimes owing someone something, or vice versa, keeps you in a relationship, and sometimes  that's what we want. A sweater, a pair of headphones or an old pack of rolling papers left at your ex's house is security that you might see them again. Let it go today, Capricorn.
Aquarius
There's nothing better than watching the people you love start to love themselves, find happiness, or succeed, but you might feel a little confused right now about how the relationship has shifted or how you can continue to be a good support to those you love. Things will begin moving forward soon.
Pisces
If you haven't realized that it's back to school season now and that you're supposed to be stocking up on pens and planners, then I don't know where your head's been, Pisces.

Gemini
People who are near and dear to your heart are talking shit about your new friends, your new hopes and dreams, and/or that new dorky club you just joined. That fucking sucks, Gemini! Ignore them, find your safe space, and watch your dreams become real.
Cancer
You're feeling energized today, and you're feeling pretty good about your direction... you're even feeling, dare I say, popular! Do you struggle with accepting that you're cool? Work that out today, Cancer.
Leo
Today's exciting, interesting ideas bounce back and forth, but it's this evening that's notable. It's time to face the truth about a situation in your life, probably having to do with sharing: whether that's money, cuddles, or friendly support.

Are you all about comfort today, Aquarius, or are you ready for something new? Strangely, neither seems right today: Find a place in the middle. Perhaps a new restaurant with an old friend, or an old bar with a new lover?
Pisces
You're so focused on other people that lately you're forgetting that you even exist. Check in with you today, Pisces, and indulge in some material, physical treats. Tonight's super confusing and even confrontational, so stay in if you're not up for it.Aries
I know you're obsessed with winning, Aries—not being number one is soul crushing for you. Drop out of the race today: Take time to take care of yourself. Try to find pleasure in moving slowly.
Taurus
You can be a little snobby, Taurus. Blame your ruling planet Venus--a luxurious, opulent energy. You've plenty to show off: Congratulate yourself on all your accomplishments and talents today.
Gemini
If your home, family, or roomie situation is total garbage, I'm sorry, Gemini, but you'll have to fix it before moving on to bigger and better things. The world is dying to see you shine, but how can you reach for the stars when you don't have solid footing?

Sagittarius
This Full Moon is going to highlight your home/work balance. Something should come to light around these issues—maybe you'll finally reach a breaking point. If you're working all day but can't pay your rent, it's a sign.

Sudden rises and falls in your bank account don't surprise you, you flakey fish, but today I want you to think deeply about your feelings around material matters. Some awesome opportunities may arise for you today--but how far can you take them if you're unsure about your self worth?Aries
You can probably count on one hand how many projects you've actually brought to completion...Today, you may just add another to that list if you take advantage of the get-shit-done flow this afternoon and make discipline your mantra.
Taurus
If you have something to say to a partner or friend, do it this afternoon, while the Moon in caring Cancer is on great terms with Saturn in transformative Scorpio. Things will feel way to hazy later this afternoon.
Gemini
You secretly love watching chaos go down, but tonight won't be fun if you act thoughtlessly. Your public and private life may have a clash, and things could get a little confusing. Use the productive energy this afternoon to get shit done and try to stay grounded.
Cancer
The Moon is in your sign, Cancer! Things feel strong and stable--today, the Moon contacts security-loving Saturn. Confusion around communication could pop up this evening; keep cool and make sure you have the full story before making any actions.
Leo
You're too generous, Leo. Once in a blue moon, someone forgets how giving you been, and it breaks your heart. This evening could be a little funky around personal debts--avoid stressing out about material issues: It'll create uncertainty, not clarity.
Virgo
This afternoon is awesome for creating strong connections in your social circle, but end the party early. Things may be a little too good to be true this evening. Luckily, you're great at fact checking, Virgo!
Libra
Of all the signs to power lunch today, Libra, it's you who I'm really crossing my fingers for. An authority  may see a whole lot of potential in you. Money and recognition could be on your way, so don't waste the good vibes this evening!
Scorpio
This afternoon, there may be some kind of a-ha! moment around what you're capable of. This evening could be a little confusing and foggy, but sometimes a little mist is sexy? Maybe, maybe not--but be sure to remember who your real friends are while you're out chasing mysteries.
Sagittarius
While you are one of the most intellectual and self-aware signs of the zodiac, you haven't gotten it all figured out. Today could bring you a small lesson about yourself. The world is a confusing place , but self-knowledge can get you through anything.
Capricorn
You could make some great connections this afternoon, so pay attention to whom you meet: They may be great allies down the line! Your imagination runs wild tonight, so be sure to stay objective and logical when making decisions.
Aquarius
You're not crazy about routines, Aquarius, but you do work very well when you have your shit organized and in order; this afternoon your efforts could pay off in a big way. Things have been confusing, financially speaking, and this evening is no exception. Keep cool by knowing you've got your business organized and under control.
Pisces
The Moon and Saturn are in water signs--nurturing Cancer and transformative Scorpio, respectively--so things will feel so right this afternoon.

Virgo vibes are encouraging you to buckle down and build a routine that will make you stronger and more productive, but you're so not interested in getting organized. Perhaps treat yourself to a back to school shopping trip?
Taurus
Jupiter has entered Virgo, whose playful side appeals to you. The next year should be a lot of more fun, with plenty of parties and dates-not like last year, which had you holed up at home. Today will also bring a small lesson around communication: be thoughtful.
Gemini
With Jupiter, the planet of growth and expansion, entering organized Virgo, you can expect the foundations in your life to get a major  overhaul. Stressful yet exciting news may come your way this evening--let it sink it before you react.
Cancer
Today, you're feeling vulnerable and misty eyed over the past. Jupiter--the planet of luck--is in no-bullshit Virgo now, so this year could bring you some comfort around communication. Today may not be the best day to reach out to someone you've fallen out of touch with, but perhaps soon?
Leo
Power struggles, shake ups, and unexpected surprises are on the menu today, Leo. On the bright side, lucky Jupiter is now in productive Virgo--so, if fat checks make you happy, today's craziness shouldn't outshine the possibilities for  greatness in the coming year.

Scorpio
The Moon is in fellow Water sign Cancer, inspiring you to shake up your usual routine--especially this evening. This morning may have inspired you to reach out to an old friend, but we all know you burned that bridge, you crazy scorpion. Perhaps some making up in on the way?
Sagittarius
No regrets, please, when you wake up this morning, Sag. You may find yourself dwelling on the past today, but try to let it go. You'll have some exciting drama possibly leading to a hook up later today, so keep your chin up.
Capricorn
The people around you might be super emotional today, with the Moon in sensitive Cancer, but what can ya do, Capricorn? Not everyone is as icy cool as you are. Issues around the home may be annoying tonight, so go out someplace you usually wouldn't.

Taurus

Gemini
Ew, is someone being critical of you? How dare they! It's a bitchy kind of day for you, Gemini; however, this prickly vibe may push you to take some much-needed action. You're looking for CLARITY! Will you find it? I think so.
Cancer

Pisces
Did you get a sweet text message today? Maybe, but I'm going to bet NOT, since it seems that your crushes have been shy and introverted lately. Your crush may have not texted, but my bet is that you're on their mind, and I think they'll open up soon.Aries

Taurus

Libra
Today, you may feel overwhelmed by pressure to create more security, stability, or material wealth in your life. We know it's not either/or: You can make bank and make friends at the same time. Today, though, you may need to pick just one.
