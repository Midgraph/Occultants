Pisces

Libra

Libra, you're the nicest sign in the zodiac, but over the last few days, no one would have guessed that by interacting with you. Today, you get a little more "back to normal." Mercury's still retrograde in your sign, it's ok if you're currently confused—things will clear up soon.

Sagittarius
Today is a high-pressure day, especially around your relationships. Watch out: You may overdo things today. Take it slow, especially since Mercury is retrograde. Your plans for the future will soon change.

Capricorn
Flexibility is key today. Things won't play our fairly, and people might go overboard. But such is life, right, Capricorn? Besides, you're so pessimistic—I'm sure you didn't wake up assuming today would be the best day of your life, so, whatevz!

Aquarius
Something you thought was just fun and games will turn out to be much, much more potent and wild late this morning. Normally, you keep things tame during work hours, but Mercury's retrograde, so I guess anything goes.

Pisces
TGIF, am I right, Pisces? Probably not—you Pisces people usually keep strange schedules. Waiting for Friday is a concept that sounds horribly restrictive to you. Pressure is high today, so be the most responsible version of you.

Gemini
The Moon enters your sign today, Gemini! But, unfortunately, that doesn't mean that things will be easy. Expect challenges in the home and in your relationships. Find solace at work, where you can blame your boss for you not being able to answer the phone.

Tonight's super tense, but warrior Mars is in your sign, so you should be just fine. Some stress around your goals could come up this evening, but it's nothing you can't overcome with some thoughtful communication.

Libra
The first half of your day feels a little dark . Things will lighten up later, when the Moon enters fellow Air sign Gemini. It's not a great evening for taking action—kick back and relax instead.

Scorpio
Weird situations or dramas around debts  may go down today. Be as mature as possible, and resist the urge to gossip, lie, or trick whomever you're dealing with.

Sagittarius
Today's very high pressure. The weight of your responsibilities is very heavy, and it's not very Sag to be so tied down. No worries, dear Centaur: Your strength will grow and match the weight you're carrying soon enough!

Capricorn
Don't expect much of anything to go as planned this evening. This might be annoying, Capricorn—I know how much you love your schedule. You might get into a stupid argument with someone about something political or philosophical. On the bright side, you'll probably win.

Aquarius
The Moon enters fellow Air sign Gemini, a sign that loves to push boundaries  and loves to flirt. Today's cosmic weather, however, isn't too welcoming to Gemini's airy vibe. Take it super slow today.

Pisces
The Moon enters Gemini today, encouraging you to think and talk about what you need to do in order to be more comfortable in your home, or even around you family. It's a high-pressure day: Be gentle with yourself.

Aries
You're super optimistic and forgiving, but you also have a temper—one that's set off pretty easily by people who feed off your good vibes and give you a garbage attitude in return. Ew, who wants ungrateful people? No one! Say goodbye to hangers-on today, Aries!

Taurus
Some old piece of advice that sounded really stupid to you when you first heard it may have some value to you today. Your schedule is disorganized, but that seems to be a trend for you lately— make an effort to sort that out today.

It's time to revisit a conversation you've had with someone you connect with on a creative or flirtatious level. Past muses will come around to say hi. Do they still inspire you? Gemini, reflect today on how your tastes have changed.

Cancer
Past decisions you've made around home or family matters come up today, Cancer. Are you glad with the way things have turned out? If not, today's a great to consider how to move forward.

Leo
You may have recently received some information that wasn't totally true or fully thought out. Today you'll learn what the full story is. Mercury is retrograde: Don't try to think clearly. Instead, unleash your inner poet.

Virgo
Solitude is an important theme for Virgos—after all, your Tarot card is the Hermit. Today you'll reconsider some of your Hermit-like qualities. Perhaps it's time to come back to civilization? Or maybe you need more time up on that mountain. Only you know for sure.

Libra
You're great at placing yourself in someone else's shoes—in fact, you're so good, often astrologers say that's one of Libra's worst characteristics, because you tend to think more about others than yourself. You'll learn a lot today about whether or not this is true of you.

Scorpio
You're excellent at understanding people's motivations and you're highly psychic, Scorpio, but that doesn't mean you're always great at teamwork or compromise. You'll be challenged to consider someone else's point of view today—and, in doing so, you'll learn a lot about yourself.

Sagittarius
Being open to new ideas is pretty important to be successful, especially if you want to make friends. But you're not here to make friends, Sag, and you know your way is the most successful way... or maybe not? You'll find out today.

Capricorn
Overcoming some mental blocks around success or your career is huge today. Connect with someone who has a totally different outlook on life  than you do: You'll find major inspiration.

Aquarius
You're always open to new ideas, Aquarius, but that doesn't mean you're not a skeptic. In fact, you're probably the worst skeptic! Open your mind today to something really weird that you wouldn't typically dismiss.

Pisces
We all have things we don't like to think about, Pisces, and you are particularly good at fleeing from the scary places in your mind. Today, you'd benefit from revisiting some previously freaky ideas— perhaps it's not so scary after all?Aries
The focus has been heavily on you, considering that this weekend's Lunar Eclipse was in your sign, Aries. Today, things lighten up a bit, and you're ready to get back to business as usual. Financial situations will ease up, too.

Taurus
The Moon enters your sign today, Taurus! Generally, things will get much easier for you—especially early this evening when the Moon meets with lusty Mars. Expect an increase in creativity or attraction.

Gemini
The excitement  will tone down today, Gemini. This evening you'll be really energized to stay in and redecorate your place or simply enjoy solitude. Doesn't sound like you, chatty Gemini, but even the twins need alone time.

Cancer
The last few days have been super intense, but today things chill out majorly with the Moon in laid-back Taurus. The early evening will be especially interesting, with news and connections going your way.

Things have been super intense lately, and you are getting exhausted. Today, things will calm down. You're also feeling inspired to tackle some financial issues or career goals, with Mars in hardworking Virgo getting good vibes from the Moon.

Virgo
Really intense feelings have been in the air for the last few days, but things will quiet down today and you'll feel way more zen and connected. This evening's perfect for breaking routine and taking a risk: Will you do it, Virgo?

Libra
You're really excellent at solving everyone else's problems today, but your own issues seem confusing or too mysterious to tackle at this point in time. Mercury's retrograde in your sign: The information you need to untangle your knots will eventually come.

Scorpio
As the Moon shifts today into sensual Taurus, so your focus will go from work, chores, and other mundane stuff to romance, partnering, and making deals . Socializing is A+ early this evening.

Sagittarius
The last few days have been wild, and today, finally, you feel ready to reenter the real world. You'll finally be able to get back to work, your chores, and your daily life. You'll accomplish a lot today, and, in doing so, your self-esteem will be boosted.

While the first bit of the day is filled with thinking and talking about the events of the last few days, the second half of the day will be way calmer and grounded. You sometimes have a tendency to overthink things, Aquarius—quiet your mind this evening.

Pisces
The last few days have been really stressful for you, Pisces, especially in the financial/material realm, but today things ease up a bit. A productive talk may go down early this evening between you and someone you care about.

Your maturity level will be tested today, especially in the realm of career, or even your reputation. We all know you're the baby of the zodiac, Aries, but you're not childish. Show your responsible side today for best results.

Taurus
Philosophical, even spiritual, ideas are weighing heavily on your mind today, Taurus. The energy is very heavy and intense today— don't feel guilty taking time off. Now is a very sensitive time astrologically, and you need rest.

Gemini
The Lunar Eclipse in Aries did a whole lot for you, Gemini: You've fine-tuned your plans for the future, possibly dealt with putting to rest a goal that just doesn't fit your life anymore, and, in the mean time, learned who your friends are. Take it easy today; the cosmic vibe is tense.

Cancer
Eclipses are especially powerful time period for you, Cancer, since you are governed by the Moon. Stressful issues around you home came to a head yesterday, and today is equally tense around relationships. Be easy on yourself and others.

Libra
As the sign of balance, you're pretty good at staying composed during difficult times—but yesterday's eclipse was super intense, and today's energy is also pretty powerful. You might feel a little shaken. Self-care is super important today.

Scorpio
There are some  areas of your life you're not really willing to compromise, but your ability to be flexible will determine your success this week, so start it off right, Scorpio!

Sagittarius
If you thought yesterday was dramatic and revealing, wait till you see what happens tonight when the Moon in impulsive Aries connects with the planet of rebellion, Uranus. Take a risk, Sag.

Eclipses are nuts, but especially so for you, Cancer, since your ruling planet is the Moon. This morning's eclipse was in savvy, analytical Virgo: Did you solve any puzzles? Receive interesting bits of information? If not yet, they'll soon be on the way.

Leo
An eclipse in earthy Virgo can only mean one thing for you, Leo: Lots and lots of news about material matters. How's shit working out? It's ok to ask for help, you know that, right, Leo? Don't try to do everything by yourself: Enlist help!

Libra
There was an eclipse in Virgo this morning; Virgo is sign that's excellent at picking things apart and analyzing. You'll find yourself doing some deep, critical thinking today, too, but don't work too hard: It's extremely important that you kick back and rest today.

Libra
The stress of the unknown could freak you out today, Libra, so I suggest you work with the energy proactively: Go to a museum to look at some old things, read through old diaries and reflect on your younger self's weirdness and genius, or find a private space in nature to reconnect with your spirit.

Insanely annoying shit around work or your reputation is going on this morning. Is it possible that people think YOU, of all people, are rigid and frigid! It'll pass, and this evening will be great, so don't let the morning's drama ruin your day. Instead, use it as fuel to conquer your goals.

You haven't felt terrible social recently, with your ruling planet, Venus, retrograde, but now that it's going direct, your energy has returned—especially when it comes to meeting new people, exchanging ideas and going to parties. Wear something flashy; the Moon in Leo loves gold.

Scorpio
You are more popular than ever, Scorpio, but, as you've been learning lately, all that fame and attention comes with drawbacks. Consider today how to balance your personal life with your public life.

Taurus
You might have to deal with bitchy attitudes and sneaky behavior from the people around you today, Taurus, whether it's an asshole at the dog park or an idiot coworker. Try to stay kind and gentle —everyone's having a hard day.

Gemini
Did you know that your ruling planet, Mercury, was one of the few mythological characters who could go to the underworld to visit Pluto and then come back out again? Usually, if one goes underground, that's that. Sit on this today, Gemini.

Virgo
Today there is a lot of pressure to have fun, but not much money to spend on having it. Remember when fun was free? Now you need money to buy drinks and tickets and extra K Stars for Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. Fun can be free again, though, if you just make it happen!

Libra
There's nothing weirder than having to put on a happy face for strangers when you actually feel like crap. On one hand, it's a social day with the Moon in Leo, but there's tension in the air. Before you can have fun, you'll have to set serious boundaries at home.

Aquarius
As the sign of friendship, Aquarius, you can get along with absolutely anyone...unless, of course, they're an asshole. Unfortunately, assholes are everywhere these days. The universe is asking you to reconsider how you navigate around idiots.

Pisces
Your mind has been wandering to creepy, scary, or mysterious places. Don't let paranoid thoughts get the best of you. Today is a powerful day for therapy, especially if you can incorporate art, music, or creativity in some way.Aries
You've never been afraid to be yourself, but today you take fearlessness and self-confidence to a new level. You're sometimes stereotyped as the jock of the zodiac, but that's a little unfair: You're a deep thinker and today your genius will shine through.

Taurus
Having a comfortable place for you to zen out is extremely important, Taurus, but over the last few months, issues around your home have been stressful. Some important breakthroughs around this issue could be on the way today!

Leo
Mars, the warrior god, is in your sign. No wonder you've been feeling like such a fighter and survivor lately. If there was ever a day to be a courageous lion, Leo, today is the day: Massive amounts of good luck could come your way if you take a risk and try something new.

Virgo

Libra
The Moon is in domestic Cancer for most of the day, but it's a super social day for you: Don't refuse any invitations. Something magical and unexpected could come out of any meetings! Romance is crazy hot today, but that's every day for you, isn't it, lovely Libra?

It's unusual for you, Aries, but you're feeling like a homebody today. It's possible even that you feel a bit of homesickness, if you're traveling. You're an explorer, not someone who's obsessed with home and hearth: What's stirring these emotions, Aries?

Pisces

Gemini
There's a conversation that needs to happen, and while you're great at talking everyone's ear off, Gemini, with the Moon entering intuitive Cancer today, listening is your key to a successful day. Now that Venus is direct, making decisions or coming to agreements should be a little easier.

Cancer

Libra
Your ruling planet, Venus, is finally direct! During the retrograde, which began July 25, you may have felt pooped, deflated, and blah.

Taurus
Next time you're accused of being a control freak, Taurus, ask your accuser: If that's true, then how did this happen to me? Your sense of security and home has been turned on its head recently, but very soon things will straighten out and you'll regain control. This evening, fun and adventure are on the way.

Gemini
People know you as a social butterfly, but, Gemini, you need alone time just like everyone else. Tonight, reclaiming some space for yourself is a great way to use the powerful energy in the air. The Moon is in your sign today, so put yourself first.

Cancer
It's an electric day peppered with some nervous energy, but this evening will be pretty nuts, especially around communication and relationships. Issues around control will pop up, but it could be pretty sexy, illuminating, or inspiring, rather than oppressive.

Leo

Taurus
You're itching to buy something that you think will bring happiness: Don't do it, Taurus. Whatever it is you think you need, it may not be worth the price, or it could be completely worthless. Tonight's hazy, dreamy Neptune vibe could bring the kind of fun you're looking for, but don't take candy from strangers.

Gemini
The Moon is in your sign, Gemini! You adore details: You read the fine print for fun, and finding errors and hidden meanings is your thing. These small details create the big picture; today, Gemini, embrace this big picture. Don't overthink things today—you'll drive yourself crazy.

Cancer
To tell you today would be an emotional day would be cheating, since every day is emotional for you. However, today is particularly sensitive. If someone hurts your feelings, I promise, Cancer: They're stupid, they don't know what they're talking about, and they were trying to piss you off.

Leo
The Moon is in a super social sign, Gemini, and you're so feeling up for networking and meeting new people; however, things may not go as planned. Watch out for used car salesmen. Flexibility is your key to a great evening, but perhaps skip the transit drama, and invite people over rather than going out.

Virgo
Things might feel too good to be true today, but I want you to stay optimistic: Even if things don't work out, you can call today practice for when they finally do. Your partners are feeling freaky and weird tonight—get it, Virgo!

Libra
The Moon is in fellow intellectual Air sign Gemini, inspiring you to check out a museum or two. But maybe don't bother? The pretentious assholes you'll run into today will make you nauseous. Especially if they're wearing fedoras.

Scorpio
You might get way too mixed up in other people's business today, Scorpio—but let's face it, you love a good drama, and you love secrets. Dirty laundry is your thing. Tonight's annoying if you have over-complicated plans. Keep it simple for a successful Friday night.

Sagittarius
You are the luckiest sign in the zodiac, Sagittarius, and today, with the Moon in your opposite sign, Gemini, you indeed could get lucky. Just don't make any promises, or dates, you can't keep. For some unknown reason, you wild centaur, people are counting on you.

Capricorn
The Moon in logical Gemini has you meditating on your schedule and how you can improve things. First step: you have to create a better work/life balance. A lack of harmony between work and home will bite you in the butt today. Get on fixing that.

Aquarius
The Moon is in fellow social Air sign Gemini, but you're feeling a little torn: Are you a flirtatious Aquarius today, or are you really not feeling that romantic vibe? Perhaps today you'd rather keep it platonic. Either way, watch out for miscommunications this evening.

Pisces
There's a weird amount of pressure on you today, Pisces, but if you can get through today, you can do anything. Your partnerships demand plenty of attention at this time, but you can't sacrifice your need for alone time or your desire for success.

Aries
The Moon in luxurious Taurus tends to bring your mind to material matters: your money, your looks, your outfit, all of which look great! Lately, however, you've felt under-appreciated. No worries, in a few days, Venus will end its current retrograde, and all will be well with the world. 

Taurus
Your ruling planet, Venus, is retrograde and out of sorts, but whatever: The Moon is in your sign today. It's a fine day, especially if you're reading this after mid-morning, which is when you'll be really, really annoyed.

Gemini
The Moon is in zen Taurus today, and your mind is drifting off toward deep matters. What secrets lurk around you? What's your twin hiding behind their back, Gemini? You might be the zodiac gossip, but you don't like to pry. Today, however, you may be inclined to.

Cancer
The Moon is in Earthy Taurus, a sign that's quite compatible with your Water vibes, Cancer. Sleep in if you want to avoid drama, and forgive your friend or lover who freaked out at you early today— it was a stressful morning, but the rest of the day will be chill.

Leo
You love the spotlight, but this morning things could get a little tense or awkward. Don't post or tweet anything unless you're sure you'll get the reaction you want. The rest of the day is productive, with plenty of good vibes.

Virgo
It's a stressful morning; you're waking up to unusual and possibly troubling dreams and ideas. No worries, though: the rest of the day will be as smooth as fellow Virgo Beyonce's skin. You might be the most practical sign, but today, embrace your psychic side.

Libra
This morning is filled with drama, but it's not yours, so who cares? The rest of the day is easygoing, with the Moon in Earth sign Taurus. You're extra psychic and tapped in today, too: Perhaps bust out your tarot deck?

Scorpio
The Moon is in Taurus, your opposite sign, bringing your focus to partnerships. This morning was rough, but the rest of the day won't be so hard—especially if you're willing to compromise !

Sagittarius
The Moon is in grounded, stable Taurus. Despite any chaos, you'll be able to accomplish your goals, even though your plans today will go through a few adjustments. No guilt today if you need to cancel today, Sag—you can't please everyone. 

Capricorn
The Moon is in fellow Earth sign Taurus, and today has a flirtatious energy. This morning is stressful, but hey, sometimes you get high off tension, Capricorn. The rest of the day is fun, creative and playful. Say yes to party invitations. 

Aquarius
You might wake up this morning feeling tense and boxed in, but it'll pass. It's a lovely day to play hooky and veg out on the couch, with the Moon in lazy, lazy Taurus. You might be the weirdo of the zodiac, Aquarius, but you have a lovely home. Enjoy it.

Pisces
This morning kind of sucks, but knowing you, Pisces, you likely slept through it. If you didn't, I'm sorry for your nervous, confrontational morning, and I promise, the rest of the day will be much easier. Expect to feel chatty and social! It's also a great day to learn something new.

Aries
There's a lot happening going on for you financially or around your responsibilities; due to your ability to take charge, things could work out quite well. You're naturally bossy, Aries, and if your work ethic is strong, mega success is on the way.

Taurus
The Moon is in your sign today, Taurus! Life feels easy and things just click, which is such a reward, considering all the stress you've been through with Venus, your ruling planet, being retrograde. You'll see things in a new light this evening and you'll reconnect with your vision for your future.

Gemini
As logical and bright as you are, Gemini, there are things that even you don't understand. Surprise: You, Gemini, are one of the mysteries you can't crack. Today; however, you may have some revelations about yourself. Issues around home, family and/or your responsibilities could also kick up today. 

Cancer
The Moon is in laid-back Taurus, but you're feeling very energized, and you're especially eager to socialize. Financial nuisances are starting to clear up, and this evening could bring some sweet romance and forward movement in your all relationships, romantic and otherwise.

Leo
As an attention fiend, Leo, the spotlight usually makes you happy; however, today you might feel a little awkward, even bashful. The Moon in stable, sturdy Taurus is inspiring you to stay busy with your responsibilities. You'll have to make a few adjustments today, but people will appreciate your consideration.

Virgo
It's a lucky day, Virgo, and, with some much celestial focus on your relationships and romance, you'll likely get lucky tonight. Our heads and hearts sometimes pull in opposite directions, but this evening, the logical and emotional unite, bringing ease and peace to your relationships.

Libra
The Moon is in luxurious, opulent Taurus, a lazy, lovely sign energy that will inspire your creative side and connect you to your emotions on a deep level. Confusions at work or around your responsibilities could be cleared up today, and it's an excellent, cozy evening to stay in.

Scorpio
You're basically a professional bridge burner, Scorpio, but luckily, you still have plenty of friends around who are willing to help you out when it's needed. Today is a great day to appreciate and show your love to those people. Perhaps it's time to return a favor or two?

Sagittarius
With your ruling planet Jupiter, the planet of luck and growth, in hardworking Virgo, you're so psyched to watch your star rise. The Moon is in reliable Taurus, so slacking off is not advised— but, awesomely, Sag, you have no desire to!

Capricorn
Things are working so easily today, it's almost making you paranoid. What kind of weird conspiracy is going on, Capricorn? Whatever it is, it's great. New opportunities are coming your way from every angle. Go out tonight. 

Aquarius
The Moon is in lazy Taurus, and, if you can stay home today, do it. Improving your space to make it more comfy and functional is the best way to work with today's positive vibes. Also, super deep thoughts are on your mind today: A quiet, private place is precisely where you need to be. 

Pisces
The only sign that might be lazier than you, Pisces, is Taurus, and today, that's where the Moon is hanging out. While today does have chill vibes, your mind is active and communication is on its way, especially in the realm of relationships. It's a great night to talk it out.

Aries
There's a bittersweet vibe around romance today, Aries, but soon Venus will end its retrograde, and life will feel like it's moving forward again. Reconnect to your creative side— you'll surprise yourself and find the boost you need to power you through the day.

Taurus
You're in the last stretch of all kinds of bullshit, Taurus, especially relating to your home situation, your family, or your roommates. Nostalgia over the past may fill your mind—but remember that time isn't linear. It could all come back around again in a new form, place, and space.

Gemini
Lunchtime looks exciting, with unexpected meetings or genius ideas coming your way—but think twice before making any solid commitments or plans. You don't have all the information yet, or maybe you simply just aren't sure how to verbalize what you're feeling and wanting at this time.

Cancer
Unclenching your crab claws can be difficult at times, so today, I want you to congratulate yourself for doing a great job of and purging the unneeded crap in your life. Things will start feeling like they're moving forward soon: It's been a long summer, Cancer.

Leo
Warrior Mars and lovely Venus met together in the sky early this morning, in your sign, Leo! You're noticing where in your life you lack contentment; however, you have the energy and inspiration to address your needs. Time has been moving so slowly lately. Soon things will speed up.

Virgo
The Moon in fiery Aries will bring up some sensitivities in unexpected areas; however, it could lead to some interesting, productive conversations. They say sharing is caring, but Virgo, today I want you to note who respects your need to watch out for number 1. 

Libra
If you're one of those Libras who are terrified of confrontation, stay home with your phone off today. People are weird and erratic early this afternoon, and you're bound to have some spastic social interactions. Also, you're ready for a new pack of friends: it's coming soon!

Scorpio
Usually, if you have to force something to happen or to work out, it won't be as great or real as it would if you just let it be. You're learning this lesson, especially around your career or reputation. Sudden surprises in your schedule may throw you off, so stay flex.

Sagittarius
Unexpected flirtations will come your way this afternoon, Sagittarius! It's a strange day; you're feeling a little unsure about your goals and dreams, but the Moon in fellow Fire sign Aries is keeping things fun and adding a dash of romance.

Capricorn
Sometimes owing someone something, or vice versa, keeps you in a relationship, and sometimes  that's what we want. A sweater, a pair of headphones or an old pack of rolling papers left at your ex's house is security that you might see them again. Let it go today, Capricorn.

Aquarius
There's nothing better than watching the people you love start to love themselves, find happiness, or succeed, but you might feel a little confused right now about how the relationship has shifted or how you can continue to be a good support to those you love. Things will begin moving forward soon.

Pisces
If you haven't realized that it's back to school season now and that you're supposed to be stocking up on pens and planners, then I don't know where your head's been, Pisces. I guess you've been drifting off, you flakey fish! But no, really, you have to get organized: Your sanity depends on it.

Aries
The Moon is in your sign today, Aries! Congratulations ! What'll you do with all this lunar love? Of course, focus on you! However, during the day you will be challenged to be a good listener. Can you do it?

Taurus
You don't have the answer to everything today, so don't even try. I know it's Monday, so you need to look/sound smart and with it. Blame any miscommunications on shitty coffee. Def go out tonight with trusted friends tonight: Dreamy, fantastical adventures await.

Gemini
People who are near and dear to your heart are talking shit about your new friends, your new hopes and dreams, and/or that new dorky club you just joined. That fucking sucks, Gemini! Ignore them, find your safe space, and watch your dreams become real.

Cancer
You're feeling energized today, and you're feeling pretty good about your direction... you're even feeling, dare I say, popular! Do you struggle with accepting that you're cool? Work that out today, Cancer.

Leo
Today's exciting, interesting ideas bounce back and forth, but it's this evening that's notable. It's time to face the truth about a situation in your life, probably having to do with sharing: whether that's money, cuddles, or friendly support.

Virgo
Today could be really irritating, but if you can stay organized and on schedule, you'll survive. This evening will be pretty nuts: You'll confront some illusions and find your perceptions challenged. Will you embrace the truth?

Libra
Are people hearing you out today, Libra? They'd better, because seriously, you are the smartest . Expect some opposition, but you'll be ok. Retire early—tonight's annoying.

Scorpio
Your mundane life is totally annoying today: No one remembers what you've said, and people being super unclear. Don't worry, you'll live . Tonight could be fun so long as you stick with trustworthy people.

Sagittarius
You're feeling a little out of touch today with what the people want, Sag, but that's ok because you're not a royal, and you don't need to please or entertain anybody. Tonight's annoying— stay in.

Capricorn
You're feeling really energized to make your living space more comfy, plus interesting conversations are going on concerning your work today. Tonight's super dreamy: It's a great evening to expand your consciousness with some meditation.

Aquarius
Are you all about comfort today, Aquarius, or are you ready for something new? Strangely, neither seems right today: Find a place in the middle. Perhaps a new restaurant with an old friend, or an old bar with a new lover?

Pisces
You're so focused on other people that lately you're forgetting that you even exist. Check in with you today, Pisces, and indulge in some material, physical treats. Tonight's super confusing and even confrontational, so stay in if you're not up for it.

Aries
I know you're obsessed with winning, Aries—not being number one is soul crushing for you. Drop out of the race today: Take time to take care of yourself. Try to find pleasure in moving slowly.

Taurus
You can be a little snobby, Taurus. Blame your ruling planet Venus--a luxurious, opulent energy. You've plenty to show off: Congratulate yourself on all your accomplishments and talents today.

Gemini
If your home, family, or roomie situation is total garbage, I'm sorry, Gemini, but you'll have to fix it before moving on to bigger and better things. The world is dying to see you shine, but how can you reach for the stars when you don't have solid footing?

Cancer
Your thought patterns are changing, which is great: When the playlist of bad and fearful thoughts that play in your head is on repeat, it's on fucking repeat. Break free, little crab! Your mind is expanding, and new experiences are coming your way!

Leo
Yesterday's Full Moon was exhausting, wasn't it? The energy was intense, but hopefully you settled some issues, especially those having to do with your material needs. Today is an excellent day to vision board, if you're into cheesy shit like that.

Virgo
Last night could have been crazy passionate and intense, or at least your dreams were. Yesterday's Full Moon illuminated so much about your relationships: What did you learn? The way you have fun and flirt is evolving. How is this affecting your partnerships?

Libra
If you're working too much, that's got to stop. Your ruling planet is Venus, the goddess of luxury and, basically, laziness. Sure, you're a person, not a myth, so you must work sometimes. But not today: Instead, thoughtfully consider how you could improve your daily schedule.

Scorpio
Yesterday's Full Moon activated your sensitive, psychic abilities and your laser sharp real world know-how. You're using these important skills to create awesome things that people will be super drawn to; plus, you're seducing people left and right. Not a bad day.

Sagittarius
The Full Moon yesterday put a lot of pressure on you: You're feeling super torn between your dreams and your home or comfort zone. If you can't balance both, Sag, it won't work. Unwind today--the answers will come eventually.

Capricorn
The next time you're accused of being unfeeling or insensitive, Cap, remind the jerk that you're a mythical creature with a fucking fish tail. You're connected to Water, the flow, the feelings--but you're grounded, unlike a big crybaby. You're blowing people's minds today, Cap.

Aquarius
People are always hassling you, Aquarius. They think you can fix everything . Set major boundaries today around what people can expect from you. You're not obligated to fix everyone's bikes or broken nails.

Pisces
What a super, major, crazy weekend around love, partnership, commitments . Pisces, there's a lot of talk going on, so I want you to do your Water sign thing and connect to the feelings. Don't listen to words, watch the body language.

You are very sensitive to movement of the Moon, Cancer, and today it's full. What are you full of? Gossip and lies or integrity? Tolerance and a sense of right and wrong, or a desire to trample over everyone? Reflect on these concepts today.

Leo
Full Moons are always interesting times for you, Leo, and this month you'll be working on balancing your values versus other people's priorities: Surely a compromise can be made. The art of negotiation is a great thing to read up on at this time.

As the scales, Libra, you're the sign of balance, so Full Moons and their push/pull vibe really highlight your need  to find harmony. This month, it's all about balancing your need for rest and relaxation with your demanding schedule.

Scorpio
Full Moons are so sexy, aren't they, Scorpio? This one should be especially arousing, but if you're feeling eh romantically, you could still have a fantastic time gathering with friends. Full Moons ask for balance, so give and receive freely.

Sagittarius
This Full Moon is going to highlight your home/work balance. Something should come to light around these issues—maybe you'll finally reach a breaking point. If you're working all day but can't pay your rent, it's a sign.

Capricorn
During this Full Moon, Capricorn, you'll face having to integrate your old thought patterns with new philosophies. The old you thinks a certain way, but does that philosophy still work with all your new ideas about life?

Aries
Where do you fit in? Today's a great day to explore a group or club you want to join. Find a circle that discusses something you're passionate about or a space to play a game you enjoy. You're the sign of independence, but that doesn't mean you always want to hang alone!

Your forecast today is fun, Gemini: Unusual people are entering your life and they have plenty of insight to offer you. The Moon is in Libra, a charming fellow Air sign, suggesting you'll have plenty of opportunities to flirt.

Libra
The people in your life are behaving erratically, but you can't say it hasn't been fun or that you're not meeting interesting, smart people as a result. This Moon is in your sign today, Libra, meaning people will be feeling as diplomatic and gracious as you normally do.

Scorpio
Worlds could collide today. You may run into your boss while walking your dog, so be aware of how badly you reek of cigarette smoke or alcohol, Scorpio. The Moon is in cooperative Air sign Libra now, so try to ask yourself where in your life you could be a little more generous.

Sagittarius

Aquarius

The Moon is in another Air sign, flirtatious Libra, and normally you would be feeling totally romantic and into having a good time; however, today the vibe today is anxious, and even a little dark. Clear your conscience, Gemini, by resolving your debts or offering help to others.

Cancer
As a Cancer, you are 100 percent completely obsessed with your home and having a comfy place to call your own. Today, you may feel like your live-in partner, spouse, or roommate is intruding on this space. I mean, really, what do they think they're doing there?

Leo
You'll go crazy today if you get obsessed with the fine print or the details: Just take whatever works for you and roll with it. You could get a lot accomplished today, so long as you don't sweat the small stuff.

Virgo
Remember way back when, when you had plenty of money to spend and could have fun doing whatever you wanted to? Yes, and that could still be you now, but you'll have to take some action and make some changes. You can do it, Virgo!

Libra
The Moon is in your sign today, Libra! Even though the lunar spotlight is on you, today might be a hide-away kind of day. Wear all black--going incognito can be very chic. Privacy and security are important themes for you today.

Scorpio
If you feel like lots of stuff is going on behind your back today, it's not just because you're always totally paranoid--it's because it actually is. Blame that 'nice to your face' Libra Moon we're currently under. Pay close attention to your communications today: Something sketchy is happening.

Sagittarius
The Moon in social Air sign Libra is inspiring you to connect with friends, but you have a nagging sense that you need to keep your focus on financial situation. Perhaps marry these two needs by inviting some friends over to swap clothes.

Capricorn
You're been working tremendously hard, but is it going anywhere? You might feel like you're hitting a wall today, but it'll work out, Capricorn. Goats are insanely good at jumping over shit. Take your time today.

Aquarius
At 7:30 PM, the sensitive Moon in romantic Libra squares the lord of the underworld, Pluto, in cool, industrious Capricorn. This is a tense combination, one that will push people into action. Pluto rules power and transformation, while the Moon rules our emotions and memories. You may feel overwhelmed by desire and a need to control today. If you're conscious of the strong vibes around you, you'll be able to channel that into beautiful art, powerful speeches, and powerful breakthroughs. However, if you're not aware of the potent energy brewing around you, you may find yourself banging on your ex's door . Which way will you go this evening? 

Pisces
Responsibilities? Authority? Hard work? Today is tense, but luckily, Pisces, you are quite flexible; I think you will be able to go with this tense flow. Get in touch with your friends: If you've ever scratched someone's back, it's now time for them to scratch yours.

Aries
You're so self-satisfied that you can sometimes have a hard time relating to other people's insecurities. Practice sympathy today, Aries, and encourage the people around you: Your insanely high self esteem is contagious.

Taurus
You might be obsessed with security, but commitment can sometimes weird you out. You're one complex cow, Taurus! While today isn't ideal to sign any contracts or make firm promises, it is a great day to reflect on your options.

Gold is often associated with your sign, Leo, and today won't be lacking any . Some kind of payoff is coming your way, as well as a stronger sense of security. The Moon in artsy Libra will inspire you mentally this evening: All around, it's a good day.

Virgo
The Moon leaves your sign today, Virgo, but that's all right because you're not so into attention away. Logical Air sign Libra is the Moon's next stop, which will shift your focus from yourself to your stuff: What  do you want to keep, and what do you want to throw away?

Libra
The Moon enters your sign today, Libra! As a community oriented Air sign, you love nothing more than helping hands lifting you up, and today you may get support from some unexpected places.

Scorpio

Everything feels a little bit out of your reach, but as the mountain climbing goat of the zodiac, that doesn't intimidate you. You're feeling very inspired today, and the people around you are super helpful.

Aquarius
You're so ready to move forward with your projects--especially those that will put you in the spotlight--and today you might finally get the outside help or influence you need to move forward. Moon in social Libra pushes you to try something new.

Pisces
If you're thinking about traveling or going back to school , today is a great day to push forward, especially since your partners are willing to help.

Aries
As the baby of the zodiac, responsibility isn't a concept you regularly consider, but I think today you will find deep joy in getting shit done. You could accomplish a lot today, which will be great for your  ego.

Taurus
Yay, Taurus--after so much drama and tension in sensitive areas of your life, we finally have a cute day for you to try new things, enjoy some romance, and generally just feel like things are flowing smoothly.

Cancer
You'll be heard loud and clear today, Cancer, so speak your mind. You've been thinking a lot lately about what you value and whether or not your relationships  are able take you there. Can they?

Leo
Madonna and Angela Bassett both have birthdays today. They probably would hate that they have to share the spotlight in this little horoscope, but, Leo, sometimes the focus won't be entirely on you. Material matters are on your mind today; helping and working with others will help you, too.

Virgo
The Moon is in your sign, Virgo! You're feeling confident and powerful. I feel really sorry for anyone who tries to intimidate you today: You're the boss this weekend. Romance is looking good--accept all invitations to party.

Libra
It's a totally fine day, Libra, but you have high standards, and I don't think this lovely Sunday will meet them. Changes are occurring, but they're happening slowly--perhaps too slow for your liking. If you can't find anything to do today, clear out the clutter to make space for new things.

Scorpio
You might hear from a powerful or popular person today, Scorpio. The way you present yourself to the public is changing--could this new connection propel you forward? Stay social this Sunday; you never know who you'll meet.

Sagittarius
You might be a big mouthed glutton, Sagittarius, but when you work, you work hard...and you know you better fucking get paid for it. It's Sunday, so you can't exactly ask for a raise today, but your mind is hard at work figuring out how you can get more. You deserve it.

Capricorn
The Moon is in Virgo . Virgo is a playful and smart sign, and it's encouraging you today to try something new. Whatever unusual requests you've received today, go for it. Your strength is being cosmically tested, and you're ability to be flexible will prove your worth.

Aquarius
The Moon is in Virgo, the sign of the analyst. Today, Aquarius, you know exactly who owes you what. You've been time traveling lately, running into old partners, both romantic and other wise: Why not get that old sweater back?

Pisces
The Moon is in your opposite sign, Virgo, today! You usually just want more, more, more--but Virgo wants to de-clutter, simplify and minimize. Surely you could find a place in the middle? Doing so, especially when it comes to communication, will get you far today.

Aries
You can be too trusting, Aries: Keep your bullshit detector on high alert this evening. That being said, it's really important for your soul to have fun this weekend. Go out and play, little ram, and rediscover what brings you joy! Just don't take any candy from strangers.

Taurus
Ugh, Taurus, not only are you working through some sensitivities and lessons in your own life, but your friends are way too dense to figure things out for themselves. You may find yourself in the position to illuminate some bullshit behavior for them. Dump the dummy drama queens.

Gemini
Today will be productive, I promise, even though I know you feel pressured from all sides. Seek inspiration from powerful, influential people--you may even meet someone who fits this description! Get out of the house this evening and do not respond to any important e-mails.

Leo
I'm not going to lie: Today is a little awkward. Not bad, just uncomfortable, with you making plenty of adjustments. Don't wear the underwear that always rides up your butt in a weird way. You rule the heart, Leo, and yours in huge. It's a little achey today, so pamper and love yourself, flaws and all.

Virgo
The Moon is in your sign, Virgo! What will you do will all this lunar love shining down on you? You'll likely run into some powerful, helpful people whom you could possible have some fun with. You'll also probably confront a confusing dynamic in your life.

Libra
Today, someone influential will approve an adventure you're eager to embark on. You're not afraid to take risks, but it's important for you to feel like you have a sturdy home base before you take off into the unknown. In other news, make sure you have your keys and wallet when you go out tonight--tonight may be forgetful or klutzy.

Scorpio
It's an awesome day, Scorpio! Juicy news could be on its way, and you're a problem solving machine this afternoon. This evening, while everyone's walking about in a confused haze, I think you could enjoy Neptune's cloak of mist and fantasy, so long as you don't make any too-serious decisions.

Sagittarius
You're an intellectual, Sagittarius; you don't usually fret about things like money, or your massive credit card debt, or any of those silly, worldly worries. Fortunately, today some great connection or action could take place around your reputation and material security. Later today, you will be pulled in two directions: the spotlight versus your safe space. Find the middle ground.

Capricorn
The Moon is in fellow Earth sign, Virgo, encouraging you to try something new today. Today's excellent vibes around communication and you expressing who you are and what you want are phenomenal. Don't believe the hype this evening: Be cautious when making agreements.

Aquarius
Today is weird and uncomfortable, and not in a cool I'm a weird Aquarius kind of way--which is what you're used to, you freak. The best way to use today's energy is to figure out what you owe and to whom--whether it's 50 bucks or a shoulder to cry on--and then to pay it back.

Pisces
If you use this afternoon's powerful energy around communication to hear your partners out--and to ask for some requests of your own--the confusing air around your relationships this evening could be fantastic instead of frustrating.

The New Moon in Leo, the superstar of the zodiac, has you wondering who your fans are. You have plenty, Libra! If your friends haven't been treating you so lovingly lately, it may be time for you to shift your attention somewhere new.

Scorpio
The biggest oxymoron about you, Scorpio, is that you tend to be secretive and mysterious, yet you're totally in love with the idea of being famous. I guess you can have it both ways! The New Moon in flashy Leo is making you think a lot about popularity: What new moves will you make in your journey for success?

Sagittarius

Pisces
Sudden rises and falls in your bank account don't surprise you, you flakey fish, but today I want you to think deeply about your feelings around material matters. Some awesome opportunities may arise for you today--but how far can you take them if you're unsure about your self worth?Aries
You can probably count on one hand how many projects you've actually brought to completion...Today, you may just add another to that list if you take advantage of the get-shit-done flow this afternoon and make discipline your mantra.

People are offering you help today, but you're unsure of their intentions. I think it's all good, Virgo: Take the extra help. You don't need to do everything by yourself. Hear people out before you jump at the opportunity to say no.
